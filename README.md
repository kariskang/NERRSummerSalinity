# NERRSummerSalinity
A repo for Karis Kang's final project for BIO539 Spring 2023

## Purpose: 
- To determine historical salinty trends during the summer (May through Aug) at three coastal field sites over the past 26 years (1996 - 2021)
- To create scripts which will give summary data on summer salinity for any future SWMP datasets

## Abstract

## Data
All water quality data is taken from NOAA's System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) at the National Estuarine Research Reserves. Files were downloaded as monthly summary data through the SWMPrats Widget at https://beckmw.shinyapps.io/swmp_summary/ created by Marcus Beck and Todd O'Brien
